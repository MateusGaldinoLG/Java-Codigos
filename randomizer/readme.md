# Randomizer
Randomizer is a project using the random object from the Java.util library. It uses it to produce some interesting random utilities such as:
1. Random Number Generator
2. Random Array Generator
3. Random hexadecimal color generator 

More random things will keep coming as i project them

## Tester
The tester.java file is a simple example of how to use the Randomizer object to do some projects. It is a simple example and can be excluded if someone wants to use the randomizer in other projects
